Over three weeks, I taught myself essential tools - from game engines (GMS, Godot) to AI assistants (Cursor, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) and version control (GitHub).",
            "conceptArt": "I used Midjourney to create the initial concept art, inspired by Van Gogh's starry nights. Then I ran it through Stable Diffusion to transform it into pixel art - which you'll see in the game's final scene. I had a lot of fun playing with these AI tools and can't wait to experiment more with them in future projects!",

I chose to omit tutorials, trusting in our natural inclination to play. But here's a small hint if you're wondering how to get <span class=\"highlight\">starTed</span> - sometimes you need to draw your own path :)"
